## Current Task: Fix QuickBooks API Testing (Issue #2)

### Analysis
- Tests were failing with error `TypeError: 'coroutine' object is not subscriptable`
- The issue was related to how async mocks were being configured in the `test_quickbooks.py` file
- Tests are trying to validate QuickBooks OAuth token exchange and company info retrieval functionality

### Background
- QuickBooks integration is a core feature of PocketCFO, providing access to user's accounting data
- Backend uses httpx for async HTTP requests to QuickBooks API
- Tests need to properly mock these async responses

### Key Files Involved
- `backend/tests/test_quickbooks.py` - Main test file that needed fixing
- `backend/api/clients/quickbooks.py` - Contains the actual QuickBooks client implementation
- `backend/api/services/quickbooks.py` - Higher-level service that uses the client

### Fixed Tests
1. `test_exchange_code_for_tokens` - Testing OAuth code exchange
   - Fixed by adding the `realm_id` field to the mock response
2. `test_exchange_code_for_tokens_success` - Alternative test for OAuth success case
   - This test was working correctly after fixing the client code
3. `test_exchange_code_for_tokens_request_error` - Testing error handling for network issues
   - Fixed by using `httpx.RequestError` instead of generic `Exception` for side effect

### Steps
- [x] Fix the AsyncMock configuration for the `response.json()` method
- [x] Update tests to properly handle awaitable coroutines
- [x] Ensure all tests follow best practices for async testing with pytest-asyncio
- [x] Verify all tests pass when run inside the Docker container
- [ ] Consider adding additional tests for the QuickBooks client in the future

### Current Progress
- We've fixed the missing `await` keyword in the `exchange_code_for_tokens` method
- All tests are now passing successfully
- We've documented best practices for testing async code in the project documentation
