Title: Setup: Initialize Vite + Vue 3 Project
Description:
The task involves creating a new project using Vite with the Vue 3 template. After completing the setup, relevant documentation files (project.md, .github/progress.md, architecture.md) need to be updated with decisions and status.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initialize a Vite + Vue 3 project in the `trustyowl/trustyowl-site` directory.
- [ ] Ensure the project uses the Vue 3 Composition API.
- [ ] Update `project.md` with the setup details.
- [ ] Update `.github/progress.md` with the task status.
- [ ] Update `architecture.md` with any relevant architectural decisions.

## Implementation Plan
### Current Status: Planning Phase

### Steps
1. [ ] Verify the current state of the `trustyowl-site` directory to ensure no conflicting setup exists.
    - Details: Check for existing Vite or Vue configurations.
    - Files to modify: None (inspection only).
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes: Ensure the directory is ready for a new Vite + Vue 3 setup.

2. [ ] Initialize a new Vite project with the Vue 3 template.
    - Details: Use the `npm create vite@latest` command to set up the project.
    - Files to modify: Entire `trustyowl-site` directory.
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes: Ensure the setup aligns with the acceptance criteria.

3. [ ] Configure the project to use the Vue 3 Composition API.
    - Details: Verify and update the project files to ensure the Composition API is used.
    - Files to modify: `vite.config.js`, `src/main.js`, and other relevant files.
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes: Follow best practices for Vue 3 projects.

4. [ ] Update `project.md` with the setup details.
    - Details: Document the Vite + Vue 3 setup process and decisions.
    - Files to modify: `project.md`.
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes: Include any relevant commands and configurations.

5. [ ] Update `.github/progress.md` with the task status.
    - Details: Add a summary of the completed task and any learnings.
    - Files to modify: `.github/progress.md`.
    - Status: Not Started
    - Notes: Ensure the progress is clearly documented.

6. [ ] Update `architecture.md` with any relevant architectural decisions.
    - Details: Document any changes or decisions related to the project architecture.
    - Files to modify: `architecture.md`.
